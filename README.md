# LOD
LOD (Light Or Dark) is a quick powershell script that can bypass school and work as well as windows activations to automatically change the theme from light and dark mode. Usually schools, some workplaces and not windows activated doesn't allow to change the setting from light to dark mode as well as various other settings. This script allows that.
